Welcome to [Plastiliin](https://www.plastiliin.com/et/home-et) — a landing page created for an Estonian educational studio focused on child development and correctional pedagogy.

This is more than just a website — it's a **vision and a handcrafted brand experience**.  
Designed and developed entirely by me — from **brand concept**, **UX/UI design** to **clean, accessible, and scalable code architecture**. Plastiliin reflects both **technical skill** and **design artistry**.

## What Makes This Special

### 🔎 Competitor Research & Strategy

Before writing a single line of code, I conducted market and competitor analysis to understand user needs, industry trends, and identify design opportunities within Estonia’s child development space.

### 🧠 Custom Branding & Visual Identity

Every visual element — including the **logo**, **color system**, **illustrations**, **icons**, and **typography** — was designed from scratch by me in **Figma**, inspired by the soft and creative feel of clay (“plastiliin”).

### Design Language

- Brand style mimics tactile, warm, and colorful plasticine (clay)
- Tabbed sections use **handcrafted icons** styled to match each program
- No stock assets or templates were used — **everything is custom**

### Modular Program Layout

Each of the six programs (like Neurogymnastics, Logorhythmics, Numicon, etc.) is built as a colorful, interactive section with unique branding, imagery, and call-to-actions.

### Functional Contact Form

Accessible and fully validated contact form with live feedback, confirmation modal, and proper error handling — ready for production.

### 🧠 Built for Real Clients

The site is used by a real studio in Tallinn to present programs and receive requests from parents. It’s not a concept — it’s live, tested, and in action.

---

## 🚧 Phase 1 Complete — Phase 2 in Progress

The website is built as the **first step of a scalable digital ecosystem**, with **Phase 2 already planned and in progress**.

### 📈 What's Coming Next

- **Online booking system** — clients will be able to book sessions with specialists directly
- **Login for parents** — simple account system for managing appointments
- **Fully reusable architecture** — built with component logic and design tokens, no need to rebuild from scratch
- **Saves client money** — future features can be added incrementally with minimal cost

This strategic approach ensures **long-term value** for the client and **efficient scaling** of the platform.

## 🌍 Multilingual & SEO-Ready

This project is fully prepared for **multilingual support** and **localized SEO optimization** thanks to the integration of [`next-intl`](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl).

### 🗣 Features Include

- 🌐 Dynamic multi-language content via `locale` in the URL
- 🧩 Localized translations using `next-intl`
- 🔍 SEO metadata generation per language — title, description, and Open Graph tags
- 📁 Modular JSON translation files by page and locale
- 🧭 Locale-aware navigation and layout components

#### 📦 Translation Structure Example

```json
"IndexPage": {
  "meta": {
    "title": "Plastiliin. Tallinn Educational and Developmental Center for Children",
    "description": "An educational and developmental center in Tallinn for children and adults: neuro-gymnastics, speech therapy, Numicon math, piano lessons, logorhythmics, and Lego engineering. Classes are held offline in Ukrainian, Russian, English, and Estonian with a personalized approach for every learner."
  },
}
```
